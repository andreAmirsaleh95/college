(1.1) code that corrupts the execution stack by writing past the end of an
      array declared auto in a routine

(1.2) C implementation and buffer overflow

(1.3) Disassemble shows the machine code version of C code.

(1.4) The generated machine code is dependent on the CPU (i.e. disassemble
      will produce different machine code across different CPUs)

(1.5) The call to function() messes with the buffer, resulting in buffer overflow.
      The printf() function relies on the buffer and does not count
