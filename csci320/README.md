# CSCI320 Project 2
Assignment: Project 2
Course: CSCI 320 - Computer Architecture (Fall '17)
Professor: Alan Marchiori
Team: Verilads - Levi A, Andre A, Stefano C, Tom F

This repository contains our work for the second project for csci320.  Please refer to the readme.pdf file for a more in depth description.


Overview:

The /src folder holds the testbench and all of the modules associated with it
The /test folder holds all of our test files
The /reqProgram folder holds our the 3 required programs (hello_world, fib, program3)
You expressed intrest in having a cross compiled program.
There is one in cprograms, it has a syscall race condition problem (the one you told us not to worry about). It messes up on the jr $ra at the end without nops in between. Otherwise, it works.

Thank you,

Verilads <3
