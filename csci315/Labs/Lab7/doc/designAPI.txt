Depending on the global POLICY variable, which was passed into the
allocator_init function, the allocate function calls one of the following three
functions:
1. void *_allocate_bf( size_t size )
2. void *_allocate_ff( size_t size )
3. void *_allocate_wf( size_t size )

My new definition of a dnode:
struct dnode {
	struct dnode *prev;
	struct dnode *next;
	void *data;
	size_t size;
	int location;
};
