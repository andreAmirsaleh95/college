PROBLEM 1:
1. The compiler did not recognize references to pow, pthread_create, and
   pthread_join. See the following output:

	/tmp/ccAzrKGo.o: In function `SumExp':
	summation.c:(.text+0x90): undefined reference to `pow'
	/tmp/ccAzrKGo.o: In function `main':
	summation.c:(.text+0x2cd): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
	summation.c:(.text+0x355): undefined reference to `pthread_join'
	collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

2. Append the -lm flag as follows:

	gcc -std=gnu99 -Wall summation.c -o summation -lm

3. Appending the -lm flag allowed the compiler to recognize the pow
   function (thanks to the now linked math library), but it still does not
   recognize the pthread functions. See the following output:

	summation.c:(.text+0x2cd): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
	summation.c:(.text+0x355): undefined reference to `pthread_join'

PROBLEM 2:
1. The main thread passes all of the arguments of a thread via one struct.

2. calloc(3) is the same as malloc, but more convenient to use for allocating
   memory for arrays.

3. Detatched threads run independently and cannot be joined.

4. pthread_join() allows the main thread to safely retieve the return values
   of the other threads.

5. The entire program exits.

6. execl's call to /bin/ls replaces the entire program, so all threads are
   exited.

PROBLEM 4:
1. In theory, my program is completely thread-safe.
