(2.1) A parent's heap is copied over to the child when fork() is called, but
	  from then on, the parent and the child each has its own, independent
	  heap.

(2.2) The child process can access the same pipe that was modified by the
	  parent process because the input for pipe()[0] is the output of
	  pipe()[1], so the child process reads from pipe()[0] after the parent
	  process closes pipe()[1].

(2.3) Pipes allow for inter-process communication whereas files do not without
	  the use of wait().
