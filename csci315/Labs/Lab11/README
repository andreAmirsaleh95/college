Functions: 
cd: can be used to traverse working directory, works similarly to cd in bash. Providing one period as an argument will reference the current directory, while two periods will reference the previous (one higher) directory, and no argument will send the user to the home directory. Example: cd csci315/Labs/Lab11 OR cd .  (CHRISTIAN/JACOB)

help: provides a list of the shell's built in functions, such as cd, history, and stopwatch. Example: help (CHRISTIAN)

stopwatch: provides a stopwatch function that counts up from zero from the time enter was pressed, includes minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. Pressing enter again will stop the stopwatch and display the total elapsed time in seconds. Example: stopwatch (JOEL/CHRISTIAN)

history: provides a list of previous commands that extend to the time that the shell was initialized, with 0 being the least recent and the highest number being the most recent entered command. Example: history  (KELLER)

Improvements:
Error checking: shell now differentiates between when a function exits improperly or when the function does not exist. Improper exit will be indicated properly and suggests that the function demanded does exist but something went wrong during its execution. If the function requested does not exist, an error message saying that it does not exist is shown indicating either that the shell does not support that function or that there are typos in the command. (CHRISTIAN)

Working Directory and username: shell now displays the current working directory and the user's username next to the shell prompt. The directory updates appropriately as the user traverses directories using cd. It does not show the complete path given that this would take up too much space in the window. (JACOB)

Color: Gshell prompt has been changed to a red color to distinguish it from the user input. (CHRISTIAN)
