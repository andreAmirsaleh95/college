PRE-LAB QUESTIONS:

1. Doubly linked lists are suitable for use in a custom memory allocator. One
   doubly linked list can be used to keep track of allocated memory and another
   can be used to keep track of unallocated memory.

2. Stacks / heaps

3. External fragmentation: Holes of unallocated blocks (in memory). This
   happens when a relatively old process is killed and its memory is freed,
   resulting in an unallocated block(s) that is surrounded by allocated
   blocks; thus, making the efficient re-allocation of that freed space more
   difficult.

4. Internal fragmentation: Wasted space within allocated blocks. This happens
   when a process allocates a block(s) of memory that is larger than necessary.

5. First-fit (allocation-policy): Processes allocate the first section of
   memory that is large enough.
      Advantage: fast
      Disadvantage: innefficient memory usage

6. Best-fit (allocation-policy): Processes allocate the smallest possible
   sections of unallocated memory.
      - Advantage: efficient memory usage
      - Disadvantage: slow

7. Worst-fit (allocation policy): Processes allocate the largest possible
   sections of unallocated memory
      - Advantage: reduces fragmentation
      - Disadvantage: slow


LAB 8 QUESTIONS:

1.1) Only external fragmentation is allowed.

1.2) - allocation time
     - deallocation time ...both of which are measured using a timer

1.3)
