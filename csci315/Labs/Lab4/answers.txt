(4.1) Just because the fork() function was not called, does not mean that two
	  processes are not running!

(4.2) Socket functionality is provided by an external library because we had to
	  #include <sys/socket.h>

(4.3) Sockets are better for servers; whereas, pipes are better for local
	  inter-process communication.
	  Pipes : Monolithic Systems :: Sockets : Layered Systems (?)

(4.4) gethostbyname(3) allows us to validate the user-entered host-name by
	  returning NULL for any given invalid hostname. If invalid, terminate the
	  program.

(4.5) getnameinfo(3) should be used instead because it is protocol-independent,
	  reentrant, and eliminates dependencies on different IP-Address standards.
