// Assignment: Homework 2, Problem 3// Authors: Andre Amirsaleh and Stefano Cobelli//// Date: 9/12/16// Class: CSCI 208 - Programming Language Design// Section: 2:00PM-3:00PM// Professor: Benoit Razet// The primitives in this language include Bool, Color, and Int// This is a commentcomposite1 Dog [ BEAGLE, GREYHOUND, RETRIEVER ];// composite1 is an enumcomposite2 Cat [ Bool longHaired, Color color ];//composite2 is a classcomposite3 Lifespan [ 0, 25 ];//composite3 is a subrangecomposite4 Pets [ Dog, Cat ];//Pets is a parent classvoid main() {	Dog woof = BEAGLE;	Dog bark = RETRIEVER;		if (woof < bark) print("bark is a larger dog"); // this prints	//This shows that Dog types are comparable	Cat meow = [True, "Black"];	//This is a class constructor	print(meow.color); // prints Black	//This prints a property of the class	Lifespan dogYears = 15; // legal code	//This works because it is in the subrange of 0 to 25		// Lifespan turtleYears = 200; // illegal code because 200 is not a								   // value in the Lifespan type	//This doesn’t work because it is over 25	Pets family = meow;	//Sets a child class to a parent class type	if (family.is(Cat)) print("it was a cat"); // this prints	//Can extract child class’ type	//Program recognizes the family variable to be of type Cat even though it	//was declared as Pets}
