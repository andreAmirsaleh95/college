1. i : int
   arr : Ref(int->int)
   Color = Green + Red + Brown + Yellow
   Leaf = Color * int
   leaf : Ref(Leaf)
   MapleTree = float * Ref(int->Leaf)

2. See Prob2.java

3. FlytingToaster is strongly typed (more so than Java) because every variable has a type, and there is no implicit coercion.

4. (a) Dynamically typed and statically typed.

   (b) Dynamically typed languages are able to assign a value of type A to a
       variable, and then later assign a value of type B to that variable.
       Statically typed languages are not able to do things like that.

   (c) Foozle is a dynamically typed language.

   (d) Banana is a statically typed language.
