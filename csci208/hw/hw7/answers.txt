1. See file: prob1.pdf

2. Pass-by-value-shallow (prints "2\n5\n")

3. See files: prob3a.cpp and prob3b.cpp and NOT prob3.cpp (I pushed that by accident)

4. (a) 4
       4
       36

       Note: the output shown above is what we got when we ran our Prob4.java file,
       So peep that for partial credit.

   (b) 3        = initial a-value (printed by sqr's first line of code)
       4        = previous a-value + 1 (printed by sqr's first call to dbl)
       5        = previous a-value + 1 (printed by sqr's second call to dbl)
       48       = 6 * 8 = (3 + 3) * (4 + 4) = (first call to dbl) * (second call to dbl) (note: printed by main)
    
   (c) variable scoping

5. See file: shortcircuit.cpp
