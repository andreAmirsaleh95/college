I would like to implement a stenography program (a virtual steno machine). The
purpose of said program is to translate pre-defined shortcuts to full-length
words in real time. This project would give me the opportunity to showcase
Scala's OOP as well as its ease of use with lists and arrays while maintaining
a speedy transfer of data. Given the nature of the assignment, this project
could also give me an opportunity to take advantage of Scala's GUI programming
as well as other paradigms. The point is that I should be able to easily
implement more and more features for such a program given the nature of Scala.
