Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to summarize what
you learned about whether first babies arrive late.

Q1: Which summary statistics would you use if you wanted to get a story on the
evening news?

A1: I would use the difference in means because 13 hours sounds significant.

Q2: Which ones would you use if you wanted to reassure an anxious patient?

A2: I would use Cohen's difference because that more accurately depicts the
    data's insignificance.

Q3: Finally, imagine that you are Cecil Adams, author of The Straight Dope
    (http://straightdope.com), and your job is to answer the question, “Do
    first babies arrive late?” Write a paragraph that uses the results in this
    chapter to answer the question clearly, precisely, and honestly.

A3: The Center for Disease Control's (CDC) National Survey of Family Growth
    (NSFG) collected data that suggest that first-born babies arrive thirteen
    hours later than others do on average. However, relative to the general
    variability of pregnancy lengths, this thirteen-hour difference turns out
    to to be less than 5% of a standard deviation. In other words, the
    thirteen-hour difference is statistically negligible. While we cannot say
    that first-born babies take any longer or shorter to arrive, the data
    should be re-evaluated without outliers.
