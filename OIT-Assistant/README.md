What is Oral Immunotherapy (OIT)?  
* Therapy for children with food allergies
* A daily increasing dose of allergen to strengthen ability in tolerating the allergen
* Supplement taken around the same time each day
* A period of no exercise prior to and after taking dose to reduce risk of serious reaction
* Patients typically younger children  
 
Why the need for OIT Assistant?  
* Current competition simply a glorified notepad for recording doses
* Ours keeps track of type of supplement, dose amount, therapy progress, and times of day they are supposed to take it
* Reminds them when to take it and when to stop/they can start exercising
* Keeps record of relevant info, allows them to send to allergist
* Game keeps the patient involved and occupied
* Gamifies and incentivizes therapy
